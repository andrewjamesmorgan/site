    <h2>Proceedings  relating to Children</h2>
    <p>On  separation or divorce both parties will naturally be concerned and have thought  long and hard about the impact of the breakdown of the relationship on the children.  Both will want to continue their bond and relationship with the children.  Indeed this will be the case even more so now to reassure them that they are  loved.</p>
    <p>The welfare  and interest of the children is of paramount importance. This is of course the  case for all parents but is also the first principal of the courts in all  Children Act matters.</p>
    <h3>No Order Principal</h3>
    <p>Many years  ago a divorce would record which parent had &lsquo;custody&rsquo; of the children &ndash; now  known as &lsquo;Residence&rsquo;. This often occasioned paper being waived about between  the parties, in front of the children, showing authority and control over them.</p>
    <p>Today&rsquo;s approach,  we are pleased to say, is very different. There is a laissez-faire attitude. You are the parents. You know your children  best and what arrangements are best for their day to day care and visiting  absent parents. If matters are agreed there is no need to record this in  writing or obtain sealed orders requiring the parties to stick to a rigid  regime regardless of the need for flexibility with most arrangements. </p>
    <p>The only  place the arrangements will be noted is the form relating to children file with  a divorce petition and this only indicates the arrangements at the time the  petition was issued and is not set in stone. Please refer to the <a href="Divorce.html">Divorce page</a> for more details.</p>
    <h3>Negotiations</h3>
    <p>Allwyn Sanger encourage parents to come to a sensible arrangement for the best interest of the children. </p>
    <p>Often  Mediation can help parties keep a calm and constructive dialog to make  arrangements. We can also help in the negotiating process and where appropriate  record any agreements to act as a focus and established routine for all.</p>
    <p>Where it is  not possible to come to your own arrangements an application to the court may be issued for one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
	  <li>Residence Order</li>
      <li>Shared  Residence Order</li>
      <li>Contact  Order &ndash; Direct or Indirect</li>
      <li>Parental  Responsibility</li>
      <li>Specific  Arrangements as to School Holidays/Weekends etc.</li>
      <li>Specific  Steps Order</li>
      <li>Port Alert Order</li>
	</ul>	
    <h3>Issue Application</h3>
    <p>Each  party may make an application to the Court for the Order sought in form C100. </p>
    <h3>Conciliation Appointment</h3>
    <p>This  is the first Hearing. Both parties are  required to attend Court and any children over the age of 9 years old may  attend Court at the Hearing. Prior to  the hearing an officer from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support  Services (CAFCASS) who is in attendance at Court will speak to each of the  children and each of the parents in a private room to ascertain their  wishes. The CAFCASS Officer will then  report to the Court and a temporary Order may be made accordingly. Directions are made by the District Judge to  be reviewed at the next hearing. This is  particularly the case where children are to spend time living with both  parties.</p>
    <h3>Directions Appointment</h3>
    <p>The Court often requires:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each party to prepare a Statement in  relation to the children to be filed atcourt and served on the opponent.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>A CAFCASS Officer to carry out  investigations including visiting the children discuss their wishes and talk to  both parties in respect of their wishes for the children. A report by the CAFCASS Officer is then filed  at court and sent to both parties. This  can take 15-18 weeks to prepare.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Further Directions</h3>
    <p>The  court may before listing the matter for a final hearing order a further  directions appointment to bring the parties and CAFCASS together in an effort  to agree arrangements and avoid the cost and inevitable stress of a final  hearing.</p>
    <h3>Final Hearing</h3>
Where agreement has not  been able to be reached with the guidance of the CAFCASS report and indications  from the court then both parties and CAFCASS give oral evidence at a final  hearing at court. The Court will make an Order based on the evidence and its  findings</p>
    <p>The  timescale for matters concerning children inevitably varies a great deal from  case to case and may also delay the divorce procedure. </p>
