  	<h2>Mediation</h2>
  	<h3>What is Mediation</h3>
    <p>Mediation is voluntary &lsquo;off the record&rsquo; face to face meeting between  parties around a table. A mediator chairs the meeting to assist in the  resolution of any issues.</p>
      <p>A mediator is independent and aids the parties by acting as a go  between. The mediator may put forward alternative solutions for the parties to  consider and such solutions can be concluded in a manner which would be  unavailable to the courts to settle.</p>
      <p>Mediation can be on issues  relating to children or financial matters
      </p>
    <h3>Is mediation suitable for you?</h3>
  	<p>Consideration should be given to: </p>
  	<ul>
      <li>Whether you are able to open a dialogue to avoid possible acrimony and be receptive to each others views.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Whether you are considering legal action to resolve a dispute.</li><br />
  	  <li>What the risks are to you if the Order of a Court is not favourable to them if the matter is litigated<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are you prepared to settle instead of litigating.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Is speed important to you.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are you prepared to meet the opponent face to face.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Do you want to stay in control of the dispute &amp; costs<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Do you want to preserve what little relationship they have left with the opponent.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are there any issues which you would find difficult to have recorded or dealt with through Solicitors or the formal court process.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are you concerned with the inevitable large legal costs which could ensue if matter proceeds to court.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are both parties actively involved in the daily care of the children<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Have you dealt with your &nbsp;finances fairly independently of each other to be able to reach an early resolution.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are you concerned that either or both may become distressed&nbsp; by receipt of formal&nbsp; legal correspondence<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are the parties trusting of each other to allow a single person to act as a go-between.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Are the parties prepared to consider solutions put forward by a Mediator that neither party had previously considered.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Be prepared to accept creative solutions which a Court would be unable to put forward and litigation may not be able to accommodate.</li>
    </ul>
  	<p>Once the  mediation sessions have concluded:</p>
  	<ol>
      <li>If a settlement is reached a Consent Order will need to be prepared to submit to the court. You will need to revert back to solicitors to assist in this process.<br /><br /></li>
      <li>If a settlement has not been achieved formal court proceedings may be needed for the courts to decide on the issues, though you can still continue to attempt negotiations throughout this process.</li>
