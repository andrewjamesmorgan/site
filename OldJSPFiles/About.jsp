  	<h2>An Introduction to Your Solicitors</h2>
  	<p>After practicing law in the City and the Thames Valley for over 14 years, Ash Sanger founded Allwyn Sanger Solicitors to create a dynamic organisation using the latest technology to add value for its clients. </p>
  	<p>Having completed an MBA at Henley Management College in 2000, Ash was recognised by The Times as taking the lead amongst practicing solicitors in recognising the  importance of applying modern business practices to ensure that their firms are client-led with the use of the latest tools to provide effective and efficient access to information.</p>
  	<p>This proactive approach  led to Ash being head-hunted by the UK's leading actuarial company to head their pensions on divorce division. Ash has lectured on this specialist subject to lawyers and barristers across the country. </p>
  	<p>This firm is  committed to listening to our clients to ensure that we build up a strong relationship to understand their needs so that we can provide the service that best suits them. Communication is a two-way process and our promise is to use plain and simple language. No matter what legal advice or at what stage we are in the process we will always:
	<ul>
		<li>Reconfirm our advice and instructions</li>
		<li>Explain the actions that have been taken</li>
		<li>Set out the outstanding matters to be dealt with</li>
	  <li>Provide a time &amp; cost estimate</li>
	</ul>
    <p>Clients benefit from being in control of their case with the support of a highly experienced, knowledgeable and effective team. </p>
     <p>We deal with all matters from complex, high net-worth divorces to simply formalising mediated disputes. We also understand and offer a sympathetic approach in matters such as administration of an estate following a bereavement or difficult issues relating to employment. We are committed to dispute resolution including matters relating to Civil Litigation. </p>
