  	<h2>Financial Division</h2>
  	<p>This application is made to distribute the marriage assets, whatever and  wherever they may be. They are categorised as:</p>
  	<ul>
  	  <li>Maintenance for you and/or the  Children</li>
  	  <li>Lump Sum&ndash; a capital payment</li>
  	  <li>Property Adjustment order &ndash; a sale  or transfer of a home or life policies etc</li>
  	  <li>Pension Sharing or Attachments </li>
    </ul>

  	<h3>Application</h3>
  	<p>This is referred to as  Ancillary Relief because it is made  ancillary to the main divorce petition and the applicant asks the court to  grant specific financial relief.</p>
  	<p>Either  party, Petitioner or Respondent, may serve a Notice of Application for Ancillary Relief by completing a &lsquo;Form A&rsquo;.</p>
  	<p>The application can not be made until after the Petition for divorce has  been filed.</p>
  	<h3>Attempting  Settlements</h3>
  	<p>Attempts to settle matters can be made by either party in an effort to resolve matters  outside of Court at any time. This is difficult to do however until the assets  of both parties is fully disclosed. The proposals to settle are made between parties on a &lsquo;without prejudice&rsquo; basis. If agreement is achieved, a Consent Order is prepared recording the terms of the settlement. It is signed by  both parties and a brief financial details form is completed (Form M1) and  these documents are lodged at court to be sealed and any pending Court Hearings  cancelled</p>
  	<p>This  attempt to settle can be made at any time within the proceedings and indeed  even before proceedings have even started.</p>
  	<p>If for whatever reason a settlement can not be reached early the following financial  procedure must be followed:</p>
  	<h3>Notice of Directions and Hearing</h3>
  	<p>The court  sends a copy of the financial application to the other party and sends  directions to prepare for the case to both parties, together with notice of a hearing  date for both parties to attend court. This is called the First Appointment.</p>
  	<p>The  court requires the various directions to be complied with such as exchange of  Financial Statements (Form E) and related disclosure before the First  Appointment. </p>
  	<p>The  steps directed by the court to be completed before the First Appointment are:</p>
  	<ul>
  	  <li><strong>Financial Statements</strong><br />Both parties must  complete a Financial Statement known as the Form E. This must detail all  assets, liabilities, income and state the party&rsquo;s capital needs. The form must exhibit certain financial  documents to corroborate the statement and it must be sworn. The form must then  be sent to the other party by way of simultaneous exchanged by a set date as  directed by the courts.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li><strong>Questionnaires</strong><br />If either party wishes  to raise questions or require further detail about the other party&rsquo;s Form E  they may prepare a Questionnaire detailing what, if any, further disclosure is  required and serve this on the opponent.<br><br></li>
  	  <li><strong>Statement  of Issues </strong><br />This  is a short document prepared by each party summarising the issues that they  believe remain unresolved in the proceedings.<br><br></li>
  	  <li><strong>Chronology</strong><br />Again each party prepares a document recording in chronological order what they consider are the events that have taken place to date.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li><strong>Form  G</strong><br />This  form simply gives the court an indication of whether the parties believe the First Appointment can be used as a  hearing to attempt a negotiated settlement with the help of the judge. This  will be the case where both parties are looking for an early settlement and/or  are satisfied with the financial disclosure made by the other party.</li>
    </ul>
  	<h3>First Appointment Hearing</h3>
  	<p>If  this hearing can not be used as a Financial Dispute Resolution hearing then the  Court will consider the papers file in accordance with the previous directions  and further direct the issues to be dealt with prior to the next hearing within  a given timetable.</p>
  	<h3>Financial Dispute Resolution hearing</h3>
If at this stage a settlement  has not been possible the parties attend court with their representatives and are  required to meet at least one hour before the hearing to attempt negotiations  to reach an agreement. The judge is used  to give guidance and can give indications on they type of settlement that ought  to be considered by the parties.</p>
  	<p>Where a settlement is reached a Consent Order is prepared in court and it is presented to the Judge for approval and sealing.</p>
<p>If a settlement is not negotiated,  the Judge will Direct that the case be set down for a Final Hearing.</p>
  	<p>Many  matters are settled either before or at this hearing.</p>
  	<h3>Open proposals</h3>
Just before the Final  Hearing both parties are required to file with the court what they proposal the settlement should be. This time it is not &lsquo;without prejudice&rsquo; but open for the  judge to see. Again this is in an effort to encourage a settlement to avoid the  expensive costs of a Final Hearing and the risks of a Costs Order being against a party that may have unreasonable rejected sound proposals.</p>
  	<h3>Final Hearing (Trial)</h3>
 The parties are  required to prepare trial bundles with all the relevant documentation and file this in court. This bundle is then referred to throughout the hearing. Usually  both parties are represented by a barrister and both parties are required to  give their evidence in person to the court.&nbsp;  The Court will make an Judgement stating how the marriage assets are to  be divided. </p>
  	<h3>Implementation</h3>
  	<p>Once the order has been made the assets can be distributed  in accordance with it. Where a party fails or delays acting on the order it can  not be enforced by the court until and unless the Decree Absolute of Divorce  has been pronounced.</p>
  	<h3>Variations and Appeals</h3>
  	<p>There are various rules guiding any request that may be made  by either party seeking to vary or appeal a court order. </p>
  	<h3>Maintenance  Pending Suit</h3>
  	<p>After the  divorce petition has been filed, an application for maintenance pending suit  can be made if required.</p>
  	<p>This is  where it is necessary to ask the court for an immediate maintenance order  whilst financial proceedings are still pending. The court can make an interim  order and maintenance can start being paid during the proceedings. The Order will be terminated when the  petition is made absolute or a final financial order is made, whichever is the  earlier. </p>
  	<p>It is  necessary to make a separate claim for child maintenance. </p>
