  	<h2>Enduring Power of Attorney</h2>
	<p>	Enduring Powers of Attorney (which will in due course be replaced by Lasting Powers of Attorney) are a far better alternative to having your financial affairs administered when you are no longer able to deal with these personally.</p>
	<p>Lasting Powers of Attorney, (due to commence from April 2007) will not be limited to empowering others to make decisions on your financial affairs on your behalf. Unlike Enduring Powers of Attorney, they will be registerable on execution, rather than at a stage when mental capacity of the donor begins to diminish.  They will also make provision for the making of health care decisions after mental capacity has been lost.</p>
	<h2>Advice and information on Enduring Powers of Attorney</h2>
      <h3>What  is an Enduring Power of Attorney</h3>
An Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) is a  legal document that enables someone (the 'donor') to appoint one or more people  ('attorneys'), to manage their financial affairs and property, either now or at  a future date. <br />
<h3>Who can make  one?</h3>
Anyone can make one, provided they are mentally capable of understanding the meaning and effect of the EPA.  This is important, and if anyone has doubts about whether someone has the  capacity to make an EPA, they should seek advice or guidance from a solicitor  or a doctor. <br />
<h3>How do I make an  EPA?</h3>
An EPA must be made using a prescribed form that can be obtained from the PGO and also solicitors. The form to be used is defined within the Enduring Power of Attorney (Prescribed Form) Regulations. Advice on any individual terms or conditions to be included  should be obtained from a legal or other professional adviser. Please note that  staff at the PGO are not legally qualified and therefore cannot provide legal  advice. <br />
<h3>What must be  included in an EPA?</h3>
<p>An EPA must contain three parts: 
<ul>
  <li>Part A: consists of notes to the donor and the attorney concerning an  attorney's powers. <em>Part A must not be detached as it is part of the  form.</em><br /><br /></li>
  <li>Part B: is where the donor appoints the attorney(s).<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Part C: is for the attorney to read and complete, accepting the appointment. Part C must be completed by every attorney as soon as possible after the donor completes Part B.
Care should be taken when completing the form, following all advice and notes very carefully. Incorrectly completed EPAs may not be valid when the time comes  for them to be used. <br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h3>Registering an EPA</h3>
<p>
An attorney does not have to register an EPA  with the PGO in order to use it, unless the EPA includes a condition requiring  this. However, the attorney must apply to register the Power when there  is reason to believe that the donor is, or is becoming, mentally incapable of  managing his or her own financial affairs. The registration process is  straightforward. It involves an attorney sending a 'Notice of Intention to  Register', using form EP1, to relatives of the donorand giving a form EP1 to the donor, and an application form EP2 is completed. The attorney must then send the <em>original</em> EPA document, together with form EP2 and an application fee to the EPA team at the Public Guardianship Office.</p>
<p>
Detailed information on this procedure is  available in the FAQs section concerning Registration. The registration process  usually takes five weeks. This is to allow time for everyone who has  received a Notice of the attorney's intention, to consider and decide if they  want to register an objection to the application. The PGO waits a statutory 35 days from the date the last notice was sent or given before it formally  registers the EPA.</p>
<h3>What are the risks with an EPA and  what precautions can be taken?</h3>
<p>
An EPA is a very powerful legal document. Potential donors should therefore  think carefully about the responsibilities they are giving to attorney(s). An  attorney can have wide powers and is not&nbsp; supervised in their dealings  with the donor's affairs. As a precaution against potential misuse,  consideration should therefore be given to appointing more than one attorney,  appointing attorneys to always act jointly (rather than jointly and severally),  or to adding restrictions or conditions to the EPA. Another precaution is to  include a requirement that the attorney present annual accounts to a solicitor  or accountant, enabling their actions be monitored. Solicitors, or other  professional advisors, should be able to advise on the various options that a  donor may wish to include. </p><p>
It is worth noting that an EPA can normally  be used as soon as the document is completed. If it is intended that the Power  should not be used until after the donor becomes mentally incapable of managing  their affairs, then an appropriate restriction should be included. Legal advice  should be sought on how to achieve this.
</p>
<h3>Restrictions on the actions an attorney can take</h3>
<p>
Whether an EPA is registered or unregistered, an attorney's powers to make  gifts of money or property to themselves or to others are very limited. If  an attorney acting under a registered EPA is in any doubt whether s/he can make  gifts to her/himself or to others, or whether s/he can use the Power for the  benefit of her/himself or others, s/he must seek advice from the PGO, or from  solicitors or other professional advisors. </p><p>
An attorney has a duty under common law to  keep accounts. The Court of Protection can call on attorneys to account for  their dealings at any time where the EPA is registered or where it needs to be  registered. </p>
<h3>Concerns about the improper use of an EPA</h3>
<p>
If anyone has concerns that an attorney  may not be acting in the donor's best interests under an EPA, this should be  brought to the attention of the Court of Protection. This can be done by  writing to the PGO with all available information concerning the situation. The  Court of Protection will consider the expressed concerns and if it shares  these, will direct that enquiries be made. </p><p>
However, the Court and the PGO only have  powers to look into the possible misuse of an EPA once it is registered, or  where it is clear that the EPA needs to be registered. </p>
	<h3>Finding out if an EPA is registered</h3>
	<p>
      To confirm if an EPA is registered,  the PGO can make a search of relevant records. This requires a completed form EP4 and a search fee is payable.</p>
  <h3>Fees</h3>
	  <p>The Registration Fee as from April 2006 is <em>&pound;120.00</em></p>
	<h3>Frequently  Asked Questions</h3>
	<ol>
        <li><strong>When should an attorney apply to register the Enduring  Power of Attorney (EPA)?</strong><br />
	When the attorney believes that the  donor is, or is becoming, mentally incapable of managing their own affairs. The  attorney is then under a legal duty to apply as soon as possible to register  the EPA. <br /><br /></li>
        <li><strong>Should the attorney wait until the donor has completely lost their capacity to manage their own affairs before applying for registration?</strong><br />
        No, attorneys should apply when  the donor is becoming mentally incapable of managing their own affairs, i.e.  sooner rather than later.<br /><br /></li>
      <li><strong>Do  attorneys have to supply evidence of the donor's mental incapacity?</strong><br />
        No, the attorney does not have to  supply any evidence of incapacity with the application (unless the EPA contains a condition requiring this). However, if they are in any doubt they  may wish to consider obtaining a medical report to satisfy themselves that registration is appropriate. <br /><br /></li>
       
        <li><strong>What authority does the attorney have when  the application for registration has been made?</strong> <br />
	  Once the application has been made, attorneys may be able rely on Section 1(2)  of the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985 to maintain the donor and to  prevent loss to their estate. If in any doubt, the attorney may wish to seek  legal advice on whether a particular action falls within the scope of this  Section.<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>Who does the attorney have to notify when applying to register the EPA?</strong>
	  The attorney must give Notice of Intention to  register to the donor, and to at least three of the donor's relatives. All Notices  must be given using a prescribed form EP1<a href="http://www.guardianship.gov.uk/downloads/Web_EP1.Nov05.doc">.</a> Relatives who may be entitled to notice are listed in order of priority under  question 9. The Notice of Intention to register must be given to the donor in  person. Notices to relatives should be sent by first class post. The notices  should all be sent within 14 days of each other. <br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>Is it always necessary to give notice to the  donor?</strong><br />
	  This is normally the case, even if it is  likely that their incapacity will mean that they do not understand the  implications of registering. However, if the attorney believes that it would be  harmful or distressing for the donor to be given this notice, the Court  will consider dispensing with the Notice if evidence from a doctor is available  to support this view. <br /></li>
  <li><strong>ust it be the  attorney who gives the notice to the donor?</strong><br />
	  It is preferable for the attorney to do this  but, if it is more convenient for someone else to do so, this will be  acceptable provided that the name and address of whoever gives the notice is  stated on the application for registration (form EP2).<br /><br /></li>
  
  <li><strong>Is it always  necessary to give notice to relatives?</strong><br />
	  If the name and/or the address of a relative  is not known and cannot be reasonably obtained, then that relative may not be  entitled to notice. Clearly, it is for the attorney to decide whether or not  these details can be reasonably obtained. If a relative is under the age of 18,  or are themselves mentally incapable, they are not entitled to notice. If there  is a particular reason why an attorney does not want to notify a relative, an  application can be made &ndash; using form EP3 - to dispense  with this. The Court&nbsp;is most reluctant to deprive relatives of their legal  entitlement to notice unless there are exceptional circumstances. However, they  may be willing to do so if they are satisfied that serving notice would be  undesirable, impracticable or that it would serve no useful purpose. <br /><br /></li>
  
  <li><strong>What is the order  of priority for notifying relatives?</strong><br />
	  The donor's spouse,<br />
	  The donor's children (including adopted children, but not step-children),<br />
	  The donor's parents,<br />
	  The donor's brothers and sisters (including half- brothers and sisters),<br />
	  The widow or widower of a child of a donor,<br />
	  The donor's grandchildren,<br />
	  The children of the donor's brothers and sisters (i.e. nephews and nieces of  whole blood),<br />
	  The children of the donor's brothers and sisters (i.e. nephews and nieces of  the half blood),<br />
	  The donor's aunts and uncles (but not if they are only related by marriage),<br />
	  The children of the donor's aunts and uncles (i.e. first cousins).<br /><br />
	  If there is more than one person in a particular class of relatives entitled to  receive notice, all relatives in that class must be given notice.<br /> <br /></li>
  <li><strong>If an attorney  is also a notifiable relative can they count themselves as having been  notified?</strong><br />
	  Yes. For example, if the attorney is one of a  donor's three children and the donor has no living spouse, only the two  children who are not attorneys need to be notified. If the spouse is still  alive, they must also be notified. However, if a donor has no spouse and no  parents alive, and only two children who are both attorneys, but has ten  brothers and sisters, all ten brothers and sisters should be notified.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>What if there  are fewer than three relatives entitled to notice?</strong><br />
	  If the donor does not have three relatives  entitled to notice, the attorney should state this on the  application (form EP2) or in a covering letter.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>If there is  more than one attorney appointed to act jointly and severally must they  both/all give the notices and make their application?<br /><br /></strong> 
	  If the attorneys want the EPA to  be registered in respect of both/all of them, then both/all their names must  appear on the notices - form EP1.  However, if only one of the attorneys wishes to make the application, this will  be accepted provided that the other attorney(s) is/are notified of the  application on form EP1. If the notices of intention to register (form EP1) do  not name all of the attorneys, registration may be limited to only those  attorney(s) whose name(s) were shown on this form and the  application (form EP2); Make it clear when sending the application  whether you want limited registration.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>What if the  attorneys are appointed to act jointly rather than jointly and severally?</strong> <br />
	  They must all apply jointly. If this is not  possible, the EPA cannot be registered. <br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>After the  attorneys have served all the EP1s, what do they do next?</strong><br />
	  They should complete the application for  registration (form EP2).</li><br />
  <li><strong>How does the  attorney complete form EP2?</strong><br />
	  All sections of the form should be completed,  following the advice given in the notes. If there is insufficient space on the  form to include attorneys' or relatives' details, additional information may be  supplied separately. It is very important to ensure that the information on the  form is correct; it is an offence under Section 4 (7) of the Enduring Powers of  Attorney Act 1985 for an attorney to make statements in an application for  registration which s/he knows to be false. <br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>To whom is the  application sent?</strong><br />
	  To the EPA Team at the Public Guardianship  Office<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>What should be  sent?</strong><br />
	  The original EPA, the application for  registration - form EP2 and payment of the application fee. Cheques should be made  payable to &quot;Public Guardianship Office&quot;. It is a good idea for  attorneys to retain a copy of the EPA once it is sent for registration. The  application should be made within 10 days of the last notice being sent.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>What if the  original EPA is missing?<br /></strong>
	  If the original EPA document has been lost,  the Public Guardianship Office will consider registering a properly certified  copy. The certified copy must be 'certified' on each individual page, and an  affidavit explaining both the circumstances surrounding the loss of the  original EPA, and how and when the certified copy came to be made, will be  required.<br /><br /></li> 
  <li><strong>What if the  donor or attorney cannot afford to pay EPA fees?</strong><br />
	  The fee is normally payable out of the  donor's assets. If the donor or attorney cannot afford the fee, the attorney  can ask the Public Guardianship Office to consider postponing or waiving  payment of the fee altogether. Such requests should be made in writing to the  EPA Team of the Public Guardianship Office together with supporting evidence.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>What happens  when the application has been made?</strong><br />
	  The EPA Team of the Public Guardianship  Office will check the EPA and the application form. If there are any problems  or difficulties, the attorney (or their solicitors) will usually be  contacted&nbsp;as soon as possible&nbsp;and advised what can be done to correct  the problem. If there are no difficulties, a registration date will be set and  the attorney(s), or their solicitors, will be informed of this. This date will  be 35 days from the latest date on which the notices of intention to register  were sent/given. This is due to the fact that everyone who is entitled to  notice, is also entitled to object to the application for registration and the  rules allow them time to do this. It is not possible for registration to take  place before this 35 day &quot;waiting period&quot; has expired.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>Will the EPA be  returned to the attorney(s) once it has been registered?</strong><br />
  Yes. The EPA will be stamped as  registered and will carry a registration date stamp and the seal of the Court  of Protection. The aim of the Public Guardianship Office &nbsp;is to register the EPA&nbsp;within 5 days of  the due date.<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>What  happens if someone objects to registration?</strong> <br />
	  A copy of the objection letter will usually  be sent to the attorney for comments. The objector will be asked for evidence  to support their views. Objections are often resolved by correspondence but, in  some circumstances, a hearing before the Court of Protection is necessary. A  leaflet is available from the Public Guardianship Office entitled &quot;Objections  to the registration of an Enduring Power of Attorney&quot; and this explains what usually happens when  there is an objection to the registration of an Enduring Power of Attorney  (EPA). It is not a statement of the law, and you may wish to seek further  advice from solicitors or other professional advisors.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>Are there any  other reasons why registration might not take place?</strong><br />
	  If correspondence is received by the Public  Guardianship Office from someone who is concerned about the validity of the EPA  or the suitability of the attorney, the Court of Protection may wish to make  enquiries before deciding whether it should be registered. If this happens, the  attorney will be informed and given an opportunity to comment on the concerns  expressed.</li>
