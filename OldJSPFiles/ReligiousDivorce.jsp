  	<h2>Religious Divorce </h2>
  	<p>Return to the main <a href="Divorce.jsp">Divorce page</a>.</p>
  	<h3>Recognition of Religious Marriages</h3>
  	<p>Unless they  comply with the English rules religious marriages may not be recognised by the  English &amp; Welsh Courts.&nbsp; Therefore a religiously  married couple may be considered as co-habiting by the English system and would  not acquire the same rights as a legally recognised married couple.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  	  With a  multicultural Briton there are many religious marriage ceremonies taking place  in England and Wales and there  are many couples living here having entered into a religious marriage outside abroad.</p>
  	<p>However,  some marriages are officially recognised in the UK, for example, where both a  religious marriage and a civil marriage is conducted.</p>
  	<p>A marriage  which has been conducted overseas will also be recognised in the UK, provided it  is recognised in accordance with the state laws of that country.&nbsp; However, difficulties arise where there is no  marriage certificate available.&nbsp; In these  circumstances other evidence of the marriage such as photos, videos or  witnesses must be produced.&nbsp; </p>
  	<h3>Religious divorces</h3>
  	<p>When filing  for a divorce however, it would be necessary to dissolve both the religious  marriage and dissolve the civil marriage.</p>
  	<p>For  example:</p>
  	<ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>With a Muslim marriage it would be appropriate for there to be a &lsquo;talaq&rsquo; where the husband has the right to terminate the marriage without having a court ruling.&nbsp; In England, a &lsquo;talaq&rsquo; is not valid and so a formal English divorce procedure must also be followed to obtain the relevant financial claims.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>A Get is a Jewish Divorce document, which is required by Jewish couples who wish to obtain a divorce. Even if a civil divorce is granted by the English Court, many problems may occur if  a Get is not obtained and so it is essential to have both the religious Get and  a formal English divorce.</li>
    </ol>
  	<h3>Divorces in English Courts</h3>
  	<p>The Court will have jurisdiction to deal with dissolving a  marriage if the Petitioner is domiciled in England  and Wales on the date the  proceedings have begun or was habitually resident in England  and Wales  for a period of one year ending with that date.</p>
  	<p>Where a foreign  or religious marriage is recognised by the English Courts, it is possible to  file a divorce in compliance with the English laws.&nbsp;</p>
  	<p>Judges often  take into account the cultural context when making their decision. For example a  dowry given by the man to the woman he is about to marry as part of the Muslim  marriage contract has been treated by the courts as a matter of contract and  the wife&rsquo;s claims for a lump sum of this amount has been successful in some  cases.</p>
