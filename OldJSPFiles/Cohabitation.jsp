  	<h2>Co-Habitation </h2>
  	<p>More and  more of us are choosing to live with our partners without marrying.</p>
  	<h3>What is the legal position?</h3>
  	<ol>
  	  <li>Over time, your financial affairs  may become entangled. <br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>Any assets in your name or gifted to  you by your partner will remain yours on separation.&nbsp; Any assets in your partner&rsquo;s name or gifted  to them, will remain theirs on separation.&nbsp;  This includes all assets, savings, property, pensions and contents of a  house.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>One party may become finically  dependant on the other whilst contributing to the relationship in other ways,  such as maintaining the house or caring for children.&nbsp; However, should there be a separation, the  financial claims you would have had, had you been married, would not be  available to you as a dependant spouse.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>If you have a property in one  person&rsquo;s name or a greater share in one person&rsquo;s name, it will remain  theirs.&nbsp; If then that person unexpectedly  predeceases you without making a Will with a provision for you as a partner,  you, as the surviving partner, may be rendered homeless or have to sell or  raise a larger mortgage to release the deceased&rsquo;s partner&rsquo;s share to his or her  estate.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>In these circumstances, claims by a  surviving partner can be made under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and  Dependants) Act, but inevitably may cause delay, distress and the expense of  litigation or negotiation.</li>
    </ol>
  	<h3>Living together agreements</h3>
  	<p>It  is possible to record your financial intentions resulting from living together  by entering into a Co-habitation Agreement.</p>
  	<ol>
  	  <li>This is a personal agreement between  you and it is not ratified by the court.</li><br />
  	  <li>It simply records what you and your  partner intend to happen with assets in each other&rsquo;s names and the intention  when assets are purchased using joint or sole bank accounts and savings.<br /><br /></li>
  	  <li>The agreement can also record what  should happen to your finances and the content of a property in the unlikely  event of a relationship breakdown.&nbsp; This  acts as an insurance policy and does not have to be considered as encouraging fate  or indicating mistrust.</li>
    </ol>
  	<h3>Remember</h3>
  	<p>It  is important to make a Will.&nbsp; If you are  not married to your partner they are not legally your next of kin.&nbsp; If you do not wish your partner to become  financially unstable at a traumatic time resulting from a loved one&rsquo;s death,  you should specify what is to be bequeathed to them in a Will.</p>
