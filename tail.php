			<p>
				Allwyn Sanger is proud to be sponsoring The Windsor Fringe Festival 2015. The event takes place <strong>18th September - 4th October 2015</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Windsor Fringe was established in 1969, making it the oldest Fringe Festival in England and is run by a totally voluntary committee. The Windsor Fringe annually stages an eclectic programme of the arts for two weeks in September. The programme offers an eclectic mix of the arts and entertainment: music of all kinds, drama, visual arts (including photography and sculpture), film, poetry, informative walks and gastronomy - all delivered at local venues in Windsor.

				Included in the festival is their highly regarded <em>International Windsor Fringe Kenneth Branagh Award for New Drama Writing</em> which, although International, has great interest locally and over the years they've received over 2,300 scripts from 33 countries, with judges including Fay Weldon CBE, Hilary Mantel CBE and Joanne Harris MBE. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Interest in the fringe is growing quite rapidly and it has over a 1,300 twitter followers so far.
			</p>
			<p>
				Allwyn Sanger is a keen supporter of the arts in Windsor and we hope that this sponsorship opportunity enriches the event and the experience of visitors even more.
