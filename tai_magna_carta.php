			<h2>Magna Carta's 800 Year Anniversary</h2>
			<h4>What is it?</h4>
			<p>
				The Magna Carta is the foundation of our democracy and our freedom – this is a very big claim to make for a document which was sealed on 15 June 1215. A translation (from Latin) of the original charter can be <a href="http://www.constitution.org/eng/magnacar.pdf" title="English translation of Magna Carta" target="_blank">read here</a>.
			</p>
			<h4>Whay was is created?</h4>
			<p>
				In reality Magna Carta was a peace treaty between King John and his barons who were concerned about the King's cruelty, his taxation policies and his infringements of their liberties. Essentially the document provided for certain limitations on the powers of the reigning monarch. King John had agreed to their terms; rights that were meant to be restricted to free men are now claimed by all. ‘No man is to be arrested, or imprisoned or outlawed, or exiled or in any way destroyed... save by the lawful judgement’ and ‘To no one will we deny or delay, right or justice’.
			</p>
			<h4>Why is it important?</h4>
			<p>
				While the original version of the Magna Carta wasn't exactly followed to the letter, it was a living document and was revised several times over the years. The charter has had a huge influence in establishing democracies around the world as well as influencing the laws of the UK. The Magna Carta is venerated by The United States as providing the founding principles of its consultation. Commonwealth countries looked to Magna Carta when they became independent.
