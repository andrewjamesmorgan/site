    <h2>Concerns relating to Children Moved Overseas</h2>
    <p>Where a parent has &lsquo;Residence&rsquo; of the children it is  possible for them to take the children abroad for up to 4 weeks at a time  without the need for a court order.</p>
    <p>It is advisable however to keep the other parent  informed. This avoids animosity, lack of trust between the parents and allows  the absent parent to have knowledge of the children&rsquo;s welfare and arrangements.</p>
    <h3>Can children  be permanently removed from the English Courts jurisdiction?</h3>
    <p>With today&rsquo;s global economy and the increase in world  travel it is not unusual for many of our clients to either be working or living  abroad. Conversely, we have an increasing number of clients who have chosen to  settle in the UK  from abroad. Cross jurisdictional issues relating to children being removed  from England and Wales can  therefore be a real concern to many parents.</p>
    <h3>Threats to  remove a child?</h3>
    <p>Where there are threats or a real risk that a child  will be abducted against your wishes it is possible to apply to the courts for  a Port Alert Order. A photograph of the Child or Children must be provided to  the court and the Order is issued to the port authorities to prevent a child or  children being taken out of the UK.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to apply for a Specific Steps Issue.  This can include that the parent against whom there is concern should take  specific steps to return children or hand over their passports etc.</p>
    <h3>Should the children  be allowed to reside abroad?</h3>
    <p>The welfare of the children is always of paramount  importance. In the past the courts have taken the stand that the parent with  whom the children resides should be able to make day to day decisions about  where they should live with the children and the courts should not intervene.</p>
    <p>However the court will consider whether a move taking  the children outside of the courts jurisdiction is genuinely for the best  interest of the children and the parent with care, or a deliberate move to  hinder or prevent contact with an absent parent.</p>
    <h3>Relevant  factors to identify a genuine move</h3>
    <p>The court would want to be persuaded that the move is  genuine. This can be illustrated in many ways. We have produced a list of  examples but the list is by no means exhaustive or relevant to all cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The location of the area where the children are to live</li>
      <li>The proposed accommodation for the children and examples of likely cost.</li>
      <li>Schooling arrangements</li>
      <li>The economy and employment intentions of the parent in that location</li>
      <li>The connections of the family to the location if any, i.e. where close friends or relatives live</li>
      <li>Support and child care arrangements</li>
      <li>Any other relevant circumstances such as Health service, immigration requirements etc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information would be incorporated in a Statement  to supporting your case. The more information you can provide the more your  chances will be to persuade the court of your legitimate reasons for moving  abroad.</p>
    <h3>Opposing an  application to live abroad with children</h3>
    <p>If you are the parent that only has contact with the  children and you do not want them  leaving the UK  you would need to show the level of involvement you have with the children.  Also by indicating how well the children are doing in their current environment  in England or Wales such as school reports and social activities (friends and  clubs etc) would assist a court to consider the loss to the children should  they move. Current family support and arrangements for any special needs are  also relevant.</p>
    <p>The court would also take into account the serious  reduction in contact and relationship between a parent and the children result  from a move abroad and where it can be illustrated that the distance between  the family is likely to damage the relationship, adverse to both the absent  parent and the children, the court can reject an application to remove the children  from its jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Obviously the children&rsquo;s wishes are very important  and any resistance by them to a move would be taken into account particularly where  the children are of a sufficient age or understanding to give weight to their  opinions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
