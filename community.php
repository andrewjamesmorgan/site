									<h2>Food Share Windsor and Maidenhead</h2>
									<p>
										Food Share Windsor and Maidenhead is a values-based charity that provides non-perishable food to people who are unable to afford a proper, nutritious meal everyday for themselves and their families. Food Share currently provides fresh cooked meals for over 100 families each week. It aims to feed a family of four with three days worth of non-perishable food. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Allwyn Sanger Solicitors, as a part of our outreach to the local community, regularly volunteer at the Food Bank at weekends. Ash provides time to supervise the opening and closing of the Food Bank ensuring that the guests are welcomed; logged in as attending and provided with assistance to make sure that their individual/family food requirements are met.

										Food Share Windsor and Maidenhead is currently running a “One Item a Week” campaign to encourage 1,000 people to donate a single item of food each week. This could help considerably by ensuring that sufficient and nutritious meals are available to those who are in most need of them.
									</p>
									<p>
										Compassion, friendship and hope are just a few values that are very important to Food Share Windsor and Maidenhead and to all of those who are involved in Food Share, including Allwyn Sanger Solicitors. We are delighted to be directly involved; we are humbled by our experience and pleased to have been able to take part in the wider community in this way for the past couple of years.
									</p>
									<p>
										Allwyn Sanger are delighted to congratulate all the volunteers and supporters of Foodshare who have been awarded the Queens Award for Voluntary Service. This is a hugely prestigious award that is described as the MBE for volunteer groups. It is awarded personally by the Queen, in recognition of all the fantastic work the volunteers of Foodshare have done to help people in poverty.

									<h2>Scrumys - Rugby-themed fun for kids</h2>
									<p>
										Allwyn Sanger is proud to have sponsored Scrumys, a local company run by local people since they were a new start up company in 2014.
									</p>
									<p>
										Scrumys is a fun, organised play session for children in the local area with a rugby theme, touching on fundamental motor skill development.
									</p>
									<p>
										By participating in sessions, they expect a child to spend some time learning important skills, making new friends and having fun!
									</p>
									<p>
										Whilst their sessions mainly promote structured play in an active environment, Scrumys are also an ideal precursor to the RFU Rugby Pathway.
