			<h2>Liam's Appeal</h2>
			<p>
				Liam is a 9 year old boy from Maidenhead who's currently in the USA receiving proton treatment for an extremely aggressive, cancerous brain tumour. This treatment offers the hope of much less severe after effects than that currently available in the UK but of course is very expensive. You can <a href="http://www.liamsfund.co.uk/" title="Liams story" target="_blank">read more about Liam's story here</a> and if you'd like to help then please consider <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/Anne-Morgan5/" title="Contribute to Liam's brain cancer treatment" target="_blank">contributing to Liam's fund by sponsoring one of his best friends (together with his Dad/this site's webmaster) in a 5K Santa run</a>.
