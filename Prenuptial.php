						  	<h2>Pre Nuptial Agreements </h2>
						  	<p>
						  		Pre nuptial  Agreements are agreements made by a couple before their intended marriage. They are not documents which will either be enforced  or uphold as a legal document by the courts in the United Kingdom.
						  	</p>
						     <p>
						     	They are recognised as binding in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and most of Europe.
						     </p>
						     <p>
						     	We expect an increase in enquiries in respect of Pre nuptial Agreements following recent  &ldquo;big money&rdquo; cases which have awarded wives a large percentage share of the parties&rsquo; assets or future income.
						     </p>
						     <p>
						     	More recently, the divorce of the Arsenal football player Ray Parlour provided his former wife Karen with over one-third of his future earnings.
						     </p>
						     <p>
						     	High net  worth clients may feel that it is a prudent option to record the parties&rsquo; financial intentions prior to marriage and the division of this in the unlikely  event of a marriage breakdown. This does not have to be encouraging fate before a marriage has even begun, but considered as an insurance policy. 
						     </p>
						     <p>
						     	What weight  a court would put on this type of agreement would very much depend on the facts of a marriage breakdown and the circumstances in which the Pre-nuptial Agreement was recorded, i.e.
							     <ul>
							       <li>the wealth and earning capacity of one or both parties, </li>
							       <li>the contribution made by either party to the marriage wealth </li>
							       <li>the planned or unplanned provision for children and their maintenance</li>
							       <li>whether they had full knowledge of the other party&rsquo;s assets and</li>
							       <li>whether the parties had independent legal advice </li>
							    </ul>
